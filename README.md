# ext-shifting
Macaulay2 code for exterior shifting, and analyzing the shiftings of surfaces

I will (soon, God willing) add an explanation here of how to run the calculations and analysis of the shifting of low genus surfaces. After that I hope to clean up the code and annotate, and make it easier to use
